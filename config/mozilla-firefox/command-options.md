# Command options

Bypass Profile Manager and launch application with a profile:

~~~
waterfox -no-remote -P May
~~~

Start with Profile Manager:

~~~
waterfox -P
~~~

Make sure to not name the default profile, as then script will require:

~~~
waterfox -P May
~~~

If you did this already, just rename to a blank name.
