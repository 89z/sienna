## MusicBrainz release

If you add a new release, the release group is created at the same time. Be sure
to include:

- release title
- artist
- type
- status
- date
- country
- label
- release link
- format
- track titles
- track lengths

The minimum is 179.5 seconds, which rounds up to 180 seconds, which is 3
minutes. A pathological example is here:

~~~xml
<track id="b9346c0a-1166-30e7-aba3-997ef3065abd">
   <position>4</position>
   <number>4</number>
   <length>179600</length>
   <recording id="0393ce29-889d-4e9a-930e-c110bb87626d">
      <title>In Our Angelhood</title>
      <length>179600</length>
   </recording>
</track>

measured by the millisecond, this track is too short. Measured by the second,
this track is long enough. Listed here at 2:59:

To resolve this, we need to round to the second before making any decisions.
